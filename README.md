# Graphics - Intro - Alpha
Graphics, currently in Alpha development, is a graphing program for functions or interactive procedures.  The goal of this graphics program is to develop a graphing tool in dot net core windows forms that is modern and allows for adding extensions, filters, layers, multiple threads to plot point, move objects or images, zoom in and zoom out.

# Initial Effort
The initial effort will be to focus on getting 2d drawing working correctly in a modern extensible library.

# Second Effort
The second effort will be to focus on getting 3d drawing and plotting to work.

# Issues and Project Management
Added a project and an issues tracking within this Github repository.

# Current Project
This current project needs help using dot net core 5+ stack, windows forms, mathematical formulas and libraries, plotting techniques, and many other skills to make this modern and open sourced.

# Other Info
However will be open to porting project to other languages, or extending functionality to other programming environments.   This project is open source so you can feel free to create your own version of this project or use it to create a completely new project using the MIT license as a base.
