# Graphics
Graphing Function

Trying to add a background worker process for the current hard coded graph method.  Once the background worker or threaded chunker is working then I can start making it more relevent to other graphing functions.

Currently when you hit the graph button it will work slowly.  But if you make any user interaction the entire windows form app will stop responding and you have to kill it.

Also need to show variables of what is being graphed like starting point x and y offsets.

Also looking to deploy a windows form app.  How do you deploy a open source windows form using Github?   So going to have to research that.
