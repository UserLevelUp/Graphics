# Graphics
Graphing Function

Trying to add a background worker process the current hard coded graph.  

Currently when you hit the graph button it will work slowly.  But if you make any user interaction the entire windows form app will stop responding and you have to kill it.

Also need to show variables of what is being graphed like starting point x and y offsets.
